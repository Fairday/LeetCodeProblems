Classic multiprocess synchronization problem (alternative names - bounded-buffer problem, blocking-queue problem, producer-consumer problem).

Given: Producers, Ñonsumers, shared buffer. Producers put in shared buffer, Consumers take out from shared buffer. 
Queue variants: 
1. Multi-producer/multi-consumer queues (MPMC)
2. Single-producer/multi-consumer queues (SPMC)
3. Multi-producer/single-consumer queues (MPSC)
4. Single-producer/single-consumer queues (SPSC)
Queue features:
1. Infinite(unbounded)/Finite(bounded) size of shared buffer + overflow behavior
2. Behavior on failure
	When a queue is empty/full consumers/producers get blocked
	When a queue is empty/full consumers/producers instantly get 'false'
3. With/without support for message priorities
4. FIFO/LIFO + FIFO/LIFO per producer + no ordering
5. Waitfree/Lockfree/Obstruction-free/Blocking producers/consumers

Implementation variants:
1. Blocking
	With mutex
	With monitor
	With semaphore
2. Non-blocking (waitfree/lockfree/obstruction-free) - Termination-safety (Waitfree, lockfree and obstruction-free algorithms provide a guarantee of termination-safety. That is, a terminated thread does not prevent system-wide forward progress)

Potencial issues:
1. race conditions
2. deadlocks
3. livelocks
4. priority inversions
5. starvations
