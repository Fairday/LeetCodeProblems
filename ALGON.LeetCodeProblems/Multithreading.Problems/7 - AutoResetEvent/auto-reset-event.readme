AutoResetEvent allowes any number of threads to wait on AutoResetEvent object. Signal allowes one of waiting threads to move forward. 
AutoResetEvent returns to unsignaled state by thread that moved forward. If AutoResetEvent is already in signaled state, then the first requesting thread moves forward without blocking.

Protocol.

autoresetevent.wait(); - blocks thread for waiting a signal to move forward
autoresetevent.signal(); - allowes one of waiting threads to move forward
