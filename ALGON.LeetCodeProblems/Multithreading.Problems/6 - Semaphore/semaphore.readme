Semaphore is a construct that allows threads to access shared resources in parallel. Semaphore has fixed numbers of permites to give out. 
When all permites are given out, new threads are needed to wait for permit. Threads should return back permits after completion work with shared resources.

Protocol.

semaphore.acquire(); - gaining a permit
semaphore.release(); - returning a permit
